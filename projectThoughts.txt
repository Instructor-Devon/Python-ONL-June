    What makes a good project?

        - Something that furthers your interests/hobbies
            - such as an app to help facilitate a pickup basketball game
            - D&D app (utilizing a D&D API)

        - Something that furthers your community
            - Helping out shorthanded public services (somehow)
            - Tech community (open source projects such as Django)

        - Showcase your talents
            - Make use of your Python/Flask/Django skills
            - Make use of some external API (D&D, Google API Suite)
            - Styling MATTERS (you want it to be pretty)



    Ideas:

        - D&D App (Jack)
            - Utilizes D&D API

        - Video Games (Justin)
            - Library system for mangaging loaning out local copies of games (or other media)
            - Video Game Rating and Reviews App
            - Progress Tracker (per game?) ALA Steam/XBox Live
            - Make a game!!! (simple text adventure, using python's input() function)
